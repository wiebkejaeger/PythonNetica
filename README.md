# PythonNetica


Netica_API_504 is the Netica API as downloaded from Norsys

BNZeebrugge_v0.py is my example code to set up a BN with the Netica API

The folder Netica is a copy of oenearthtools/trunk/Netica. PythonNetica/Netica/netica/netica.py has the uncommited changes we made, i.e. additional functions.
